# server-deployment-practice
- At first we talked about the node.js runtime environment for running javascript off the server and we did a quick review of Express( its a framework for node.js) as well.
- after that we talked about CI/CD, its stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It is a set of practices and tools used in software development to automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications, then build a simple server.

- then we talked about middleware, it a function came between request and response, also it refers to a software component or layer that sits between different systems, applications, or components, and facilitates communication and integration between them. It acts as a bridge or intermediary, providing services and functionality that enable the seamless interaction of different software systems, then we created a folder for middlewares and file for stamper that we created it.

- after that we created test folder to test our server as fake server bedfor we pushed it.

- talked about actions tap in github that provides a marketplace where users can discover and use a wide range of pre-built actions created by the community. These actions can be easily integrated into workflows to perform common tasks or customize the automation process.

- also, We tried more than one error in the test file to see the action in github.
